As part of this course work Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset is extracted and cleaned to obtain tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject of the required features related to mean() and std()

================================================================================

This repo contains **run_analysis.R**, **average_values.txt**, **CodeBook.md**, and **README.md** files.

* **run_analysis.R** assumes the data files (unzipped) are already downloaded and available at working directory including subdirectories. This script reads, merges the data and selects the required data. It also creates tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and writes into **average_values.txt** file. 

* **CodeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data
